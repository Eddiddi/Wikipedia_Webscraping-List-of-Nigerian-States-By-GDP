# Wikipedia_Webscraping-List-of-Nigerian-States-By-GDP

Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet (Will Hillier, 2021). 

Here, ```BeautifulSoup```  was used to interact with [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nigerian_states_by_GDP) to fetch content from the table containing the list of Nigerian states by their GDP in US Dollars (US$) while the ```Pandas``` library was used for data manipulation.
